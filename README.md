### Hi there, I'm Fabia Camile, a data scientist with a background in biomedical science.

ðŸ”¬ Analyzing medical equipment was the first step in my journey into data science, and it sparked my interest in statistics and programming.

ðŸ“š I've been dedicating my time learning and practicing problem-solving, mostly with Python. 

:mag_right: You can check out my projects and the documentation of my studies in data analysis and data science.

ðŸŒ± Passionate about solving real-world problems, I'm always looking for new ways to use data to enhance people's lives.
